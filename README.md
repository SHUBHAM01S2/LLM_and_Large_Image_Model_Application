# Gemini LLM-powered Q&A App with Streamlit

This is a Q&A application built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Google’s Gemini Pro model**. The app allows users to input questions and get instant, context-aware responses using generative AI.

## Features

- **Interactive Q&A Interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, providing a clean and easy-to-use interface.
- **Generative AI Responses**: Leverages **Google Gemini Pro** to generate accurate and relevant answers to user queries.
- **API Integration**: Uses environment variables for API key management, ensuring secure connections to Google's generative AI API.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for front-end development)
- **Google Generative AI API** (for generating responses)
- **dotenv** (for managing environment variables)

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
